  academic_skills: The student shows an adequate understanding of mathematics but often requires
  support to solve more complex problems. Reading comprehension is acceptable, though sometimes
  misses key details. Written expression is understandable but can be disorganized and contain
  spelling errors. In science, he participates when guided but struggles to fully connect concepts
  and explain results independently.

  socioemotional_skills: The student demonstrates some autonomy and responsibility in his tasks,
  but these qualities are inconsistent. He usually manages his emotions but occasionally reacts
  with frustration under pressure. Empathy and collaboration are present but limited, needing
  encouragement to work positively with classmates.

  learning_and_thinking_skills: The student shows basic critical thinking, though analysis of
  information is often superficial. Curiosity and initiative appear occasionally but are not
  sustained. Creativity is limited, and planning and organization of tasks require frequent
  teacher support to be effective.

  communication_skills:
  The student communicates ideas in an adequate manner but sometimes struggles with clarity
  or coherence. Participation in class discussions is irregular, and contributions may lack
  depth. Active listening is inconsistent, and collaboration in group work is acceptable but
  could be improved with greater involvement.

  guidance_skills:
  The student adapts moderately well to the school environment but sometimes faces difficulties
  in motivation and perseverance. Conflict management is basic, and self-assessment is present
  but lacks depth. Academic self-esteem fluctuates, which can affect persistence and consistency
  in learning tasks.
